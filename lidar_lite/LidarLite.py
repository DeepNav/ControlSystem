How is it connected

LIDAR-Lite v3HP (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14599) is going to be 
connected via i2c to an Arduino, which is connected to laptop via USB, and 
control system will talk to the Arduino via serial.

Why did we add extra Arduino

LIDAR-Lite v3HP provides 2 date interfaces, i2c or PWM. Currently Phidget does
not have a i2c adaptor, we tried to go the PWM way, but "Versatile Input" is not
fast enough to work with PWM mearsuring; On the other hand, LIDAR-Lite v3HP
also provides a Arduino library to be easy to work with, that's why we go with
extra Arduino in our system

Wiring Guide

Mostly followed https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/lidar-lite-v3-hookup-guide, 
but we skipped getting 5v from Arduino, but from our powerful 5VDC source 
instead, and we do not need the 1000uF capacitor either. the wiring is as:

Lidar Wire        To
Red               Power source 5V
Black             Power source GND And Ardino Power GND
Blue              Arduino SDA
Green             Arduino SCL
Yellow            Leave open
Orange            Leave open
