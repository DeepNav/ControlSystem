How it works

We use water flow sensor 
(https://www.robotshop.com/en/seeedstudio-water-flow-sensor.html) to hook to the
Versatile Input Phidget's FrequencyCounter to get speed of flow.
We have 4 of such sensors to measure the water speed in 4 directions: forward, 
backward, left and right.
In order to just measure the direction we desire, we mount a L shape pipe to the
exit end of the seasor, so that when going other directions, no significant 
flow is forced to pass the sensor.

The Math

As documented, f = Q*7.5, Q is the flowspeed in L/min, thus Q = f/7.5 which means
the volume of water pass the meter in one min. devide it by area of the sectional
area to get the speed of water.
